"This part of the project studies the migration of complex applications to the Cloud. The project focuses on migrating an existing Oracle ADF Essential application and explores how to migrate this application to the Cloud. The project solution needs to provide justifications for the migration approach choices made, step by step migration instructions, and a demonstration of the migrated application instance."
